The Herald witnessed counter-protesters getting into altercations with police officers and one self-identified member of the left-wing group Antifa told the paper that violence is the only option against the Straight Pride organizers. Cops said they used pepper spray after people threw so-called milkshakes at them \u2014 liquid concoctions that sometimes include chemicals \u2014 and that officers found handcuff keys and razor blades on some people they detained, according to published reports.\n\nCounter-protesters and other progressives on social media criticized the cops, claiming they cracked down too hard and initiated confrontations. Ricardo Arroyo, a candidate to represent District 5 in the City Council, for example, called the police actions \u201cacts of state violence.\u201d He couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on Sunday.\n\nSomerville Mayor Joe Curtatone tweeted out a police complaint form and said he\u2019s looking into allegations against his officers who helped police the event, which drew cops from all over through mutual aid.\n\nWalsh\u2019s police commissioner, William Gross, backed up his officers in a statement, saying, \u201cBoston Police officers work hard every day to protect the residents throughout all of Boston\u2019s neighborhoods. Yesterday, under difficult conditions, officers strove to ensure the safety of all at the parade.\u201d\n\nCity Councilor Timothy McCarthy called for a harder line against the arrested protestors, saying that it\u2019s \u201cbeyond belief\u201d that anyone would assault a Boston cop.\n\n\u201cTo have anybody have violence against the Boston Police department, any of its officers is absolutely uncalled for and they should be prosecuted to the absolute utmost of the law,\u201d McCarthy, the council\u2019s public safety chairman, told the Herald.

The alt-left militant group clad in all black wearing face masks and helmets resembling ISIS extremists are more aptly described as anti-First Amendment as they \u2014 like other terror groups \u2014 use makeshift bombs, brute force, bricks, chains and other weapons to silence any speech or ideology they disagree with.\n\nOn Saturday it was a satirical heterosexual pride event they opposed. In July, authorities say it was a self-described Antifa terrorist who firebombed an ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Wash., to oppose U.S. immigration policy. That Antifa terrorist allegedly set a car ablaze then opened fire using an AR-15 and hurled Molotov cocktails at the detention center, which housed over 1,000 migrants. If it weren\u2019t for our heroes in blue, scores would\u2019ve been killed.\n\nThat was the fourth attack on ICE facilities in recent months, thanks in no small part to the reckless and inflammatory rhetoric by far-left congresswomen known as the \u201csquad,\u201d who compare migrant detention centers \u2014 built by previous administrations \u2014 to Nazi \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio, who killed 10 and injured 27 last month expressed support for Antifa causes, accounts and individuals on social media. On Twitter in December 2018 the Antifa-loving alleged mass shooter declared, \u201cKill every fascist.\u201d He also called his fallen comrade in Tacoma a \u201cmartyr.\u201d\n\nIf this isn\u2019t domestic terrorism what is?\n\nIn June, Antifa anarchists also beat a conservative gay reporter, Andy Ngo, hospitalizing him for covering a Portland event, while also bullying college students nationwide with threats that if they join a conservative group on campus they\u2019ll face \u201cconsequences\u201d including being doxxed online.\n\nMass condemnation by left-wing lawmakers, presidential candidates and the media?\n\nHardly a peep.\n\nLawmakers should pass Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Bill Cassidy\u2019s resolution designating Antifa a terror group. Such a measure would give law enforcement the ability to track Antifa\u2019s movements, and prevent terrorist actions, rather than just being thrust in harm\u2019s way every time there\u2019s a protest or powder-keg event.\n\nIt will also stop Antifa from growing, as anyone with half a brain won\u2019t want to join or be affiliated with a terror group.\n\n\u201cConsideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others),\u201d Trump tweeted this Summer. \u201cWould make it easier for police to do their job!\u201d\n\nCorrect.

The U.S. Treasury meanwhile Friday declared the vessel a \u201cblocked property\u201d and sanctioned its captain.\n\nThe tanker has taken center stage recently amid a crisis roiling the Persian Gulf and escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers over a year ago. The vessel\u2019s detention and later release by Gibraltar has fueled the growing tensions.\n\nThe tanker on Friday changed its listed destination in its Automatic Identification System to Iskenderun, Turkey, a small port on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHowever, mariners can input any destination into the AIS, so Turkey may not be its true destination. On Aug. 24, it had listed its destination as Mersin, Turkey, before removing that from its system. Earlier, it had said it was going to Greece.\n\nIskenderun is some 200 kilometers (125 miles) by sea from a refinery in Baniyas, Syria, where authorities alleged the Adrian Darya had been heading before being seized off Gibraltar in early July.\n\nIranian state media and officials did not immediately acknowledge the new reported destination of the Adrian Darya, which carries Iranian crude worth some $130 million.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu denied the tanker was heading to Iskenderun and claimed it was going to Lebanon. Speaking in Oslo, Norway, the diplomat said the Turkish state and Turkish private companies were no longer buying oil from Iran, in line with U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis tanker is not heading actually to Iskenderun port, this tanker is heading to Lebanon. And we follow actually very closely \u2026 it is heading to Lebanon,\u201d the minister said.\n\nBut Lebanon\u2019s Minister of Energy and Water Nada Boustani tweeted that was not the case and that there is no request for the tanker to enter Lebanon. She also said Lebanon does not have a refinery to deal with crude oil.\n\nLate Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo further muddied the picture by alleging the ship would still go to Syria, saying his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif misled European officials about the ship\u2019s destination.\n\n\u201cWe have reliable information that the tanker is underway and headed to Tartus, Syria,\u201d Pompeo wrote on Twitter. \u201cI hope it changes course. It was a big mistake to trust Zarif.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the ship\u2019s AIS signal put the vessel north of Cyprus, heading east in the Mediterranean near Turkish territorial waters.\n\nSince Trump pulled America out of Tehran\u2019s nuclear accord with world powers, Iran has lost billions of dollars in business deals allowed by the deal as the U.S. re-imposed and escalated sanctions on Tehran, largely blocking Iran from selling crude oil aboard, a crucial source of hard currency for the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn U.S. federal court documents, authorities allege the Adrian Grace\u2019s true owner is Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary organization answerable only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. declared the Guard a foreign terror organization in April, the first time America named a military force of a nation as such, giving it the legal power to issue a warrant for the vessel\u2019s seizure. However, that would require another nation to acknowledge the writ.\n\nOn Monday, Iran said the oil on the Adrian Darya had been sold to an unnamed buyer. However, anyone buying it likely would be targeted by U.S. financial sanctions. Analysts have suggested Iran may choose to offload the oil onto another ship first, given the international attention focused on the Adrian Darya.\n\nLate Friday, the Treasury sanctioned the ship\u2019s captain, identified as Akhilesh Kumar, a 43-year-old Indian mariner from Patna. It also declared the vessel \u201cblocked property,\u201d which the Treasury describes as \u201can across-the-board prohibition against transfers or dealings\u201d regarding the tanker\u2019s ownership.\n\n\u201cAnyone providing support to the Adrian Darya 1 risks being sanctioned,\u201d Sigal Mandelker, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. \u201cThe path to relief is to change course and not allow the (Guard) to profit from illicit oil sales.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMroue reported from Beirut.

Now it is spread out throughout the country. Once it was not uncommon for gangs to kill adults but leave children unharmed. Now, the killing of children alongside their parents has become all too frequent.\n\nPerhaps the most disconcerting change: Bloody cartel violence outraged Mexicans and captured international attention for the drug war, which saw 27,000 homicides during its peak in 2011. Today, even though the number of Mexico\u2019s homicides soared to near 35,000 last year, the bloodshed seems to draw less attention and indignation.\n\nIt has all left many Mexicans wondering which way to turn.\n\nThat was evident this week in Coatzacoalcos, an oil industry city in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz where residents say gangs have been fighting over turf and extorting business owners with threats of violence. Late Tuesday, suspected members of the Jalisco cartel showed up at the Caballo Blanco nightclub, blocked its exits and set a fire that killed 28 people trapped inside, possibly because the owner had refused to stop selling drugs from another gang.\n\nVanessa Galindo Blas lost her common-law husband, Erick Hern\u00e1ndez Enriquez, to the blaze. Both were natives of Coatzacoalcos, but had been discussing moving away.\n\n\u201cWe had talked about leaving here for somewhere safer, so our kids could have a better future,\u201d Galindo Blas said Thursday as she stretched her hands out over Erick\u2019s bare metal coffin. On it rested a photo of him wearing an \u201cI Love Coatzacoalcos\u201d T-shirt.\n\nBut they could never agree on a place to move, in part because violence is now a problem across much of Mexico, so no place is really safe.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2012, much of the drug war killing occurred in a string of northern Mexico cities \u2014 Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, Culiacan, Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo. \u201cNow it is more dispersed, and that also makes it harder to control,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico.\n\nBut counting down all the similarities \u2014 deadly arson attacks, bodies left piled in heaps or hung from overpasses, massacres at parties, beheading videos posted on social media \u2014 the parallels between now and then are all too clear. \u201cIt\u2019s like deja vu all over again,\u201d said Hope.\n\nAnother disturbing trend is that young children are being gunned down by killers targeting adults. The Sinaloa and Juarez cartels once prided themselves on their targeted killings, which riddled intended targets with bullets while leaving family members untouched.\n\nNow, children are being killed with chilling frequency. In June, a young boy was killed along with his father in Sonora state. In July, a 10-year-old was killed during a robbery in Puebla state. In August, gunmen burst into a home in Ciudad Juarez and fired 123 bullets that killed three girls, aged 14, 13 and 4, along with an adult male who apparently was the real target.\n\nTwo years ago, Coatzacoalcos made headlines across Mexico when a man, his wife and three young children were gunned down by a drug cartel. In contrast, the shooting of the three Ciudad Juarez girls drew less attention.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we are becoming accustomed to this, to people killing children. I don\u2019t want to become accustomed to that,\u201d said Lenit Enriquez Orozco, an activist in Coatzacoalcos.\n\nHer brother, Jonith Enriquez Orozco, has been missing since he was abducted on Sept. 25, 2015. There has been no trace of him since, even though her group, the Mothers\u2019 Collective of Searchers, has hunted for traces in clandestine burial grounds across Veracruz.\n\nHope notes Mexico has a lamentable record in investigating and prosecuting killings \u2014 more than 90% of crimes go unpunished.\n\n\u201cThe risk involved in killing a man, or killing his whole family, is the same,\u201d the analyst said. Under that logic, wiping out an entire family \u201chas its advantages. It is more intimidating, it is easier to carry out, and it makes escaping easier.\u201d\n\nThe relentless violence has numbed many people.\n\nIn 2010, gunmen burst into a party of high school students in Ciudad Juarez\u2019s Villas de Salvarcar neighborhood, killing 15 in what appeared to have been a case of mistaken identity. The bloodbath provoked large, angry street protests and a visit by an apologetic President Felipe Calder\u00f3n.\n\nThis year, in April, gunmen burst into a party in Minatitlan, near Coatzacoalcos, and killed 14 people. Days later, a few dozen people held a subdued peace march.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s politics as usual, nothing happened. This should generate generalized indignation\u201d against cartels and government leaders alike, Hope said.\n\nHe attributes the muted response to new President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s high approval ratings, topping 70% in some polls nine months into his term. Such ratings \u201ctend to intimidate expressions of indignation,\u201d Hope said.\n\nMany Mexicans also are willing to give L\u00f3pez Obrador the benefit of the doubt as even the president acknowledges that violent crime is the most serious challenge he faces.\n\nTo the extent possible, L\u00f3pez Obrador has avoided violent confrontations with gangs that were often blamed for spawning violence during Calder\u00f3n\u2019s 2006-2012 administration. L\u00f3pez Obrador has even personally congratulated troops who allowed themselves to be abducted and disarmed by vigilante groups that are often linked to cartels.\n\nHe insists his go-slow policies of reducing youth unemployment will eventually solve the root causes of the problem better than declaring another frontal offensive against drug cartels.\n\nCarlos \u00c1ngel Ortiz is one of those who doesn\u2019t fault L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\n\u201cIt is like the president says, \u2018Only the people can save the people,\u2019 \u201d Ortiz said as he made plans to bury his niece, X\u00f3chitl Irineo Gomez, a dancer at the nightclub who died of smoke inhalation, leaving behind a son and a daughter, ages 7 and 3.\n\n\u201cWe have to look out for each other, and report crimes more,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nThe poor provide L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s base, and it is that group who suffers the most from crime. Irineo Gomez was the sole support of not only her children, but her elderly parents. Erick Hern\u00e1ndez Enriquez left little behind for his family aside from a modest, three-room cinderblock house.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of empty houses in Coatzacoalcos, a lot of people have left,\u201d said Maria Fabiola Davila, a civic activist. \u201cThose who can afford it move to another country.\u201d", "tokens": ["drug", "war", "time", "year", "government", "offensive", "drug", "cartel", "violence", "city", "country", "gang", "adult", "child", "killing", "child", "parent", "change", "cartel", "violence", "attention", "drug", "war", "homicide", "peak", "today", "number", "homicide", "year", "bloodshed", "attention", "indignation", "way", "week", "oil", "industry", "city", "coast", "state", "resident", "gang", "turf", "business", "owner", "threat", "violence", "member", "cartel", "nightclub", "exit", "fire", "people", "owner", "drug", "gang", "law", "husband", "blaze", "native", "kid", "future", "hand", "metal", "coffin", "photo", "\u201c", "coatzacoalcos", "t", "shirt", "place", "part", "violence", "problem", "place", "drug", "war", "killing", "string", "city", "security", "analyst", "similarity", "arson", "attack", "body", "heap", "overpass", "massacre", "party", "video", "medium", "parallel", "deja", "vu", "trend", "child", "killer", "adult", "cartel", "killing", "target", "bullet", "family", "member", "child", "frequency", "boy", "father", "state", "robbery", "state", "gunman", "home", "bullet", "girl", "adult", "male", "target", "year", "headline", "man", "wife", "child", "drug", "cartel", "contrast", "shooting", "girl", "attention", "people", "child", "activist", "brother", "trace", "group", "trace", "burial", "ground", "record", "killing", "%", "crime", "risk", "man", "family", "analyst", "logic", "family", "advantage", "violence", "people", "gunman", "party", "school", "student", "neighborhood", "case", "identity", "bloodbath", "street", "protest", "visit", "year", "gunman", "party", "people", "day", "dozen", "people", "peace", "march", "politic", "nothing", "indignation", "cartel", "government", "leader", "response", "approval", "rating", "%", "poll", "month", "term", "rating", "expression", "indignation", "benefit", "doubt", "president", "crime", "challenge", "extent", "confrontation", "gang", "spawning", "violence", "administration", "troop", "group", "cartel", "policy", "youth", "unemployment", "root", "cause", "problem", "offensive", "drug", "cartel", "president", "people", "people", "plan", "niece", "dancer", "nightclub", "smoke", "inhalation", "son", "daughter", "report", "crime", "base", "group", "crime", "support", "child", "parent", "family", "room", "cinderblock", "house", "lot", "house", "lot", "people", "activist", "country"]}, {"newspaper_name": "bostonherald", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/08/30/trial-in-9-11-case-at-guantanamo-gets-early-2021-start-date/", "publication_date": "2019-08-30T00:00:00", "collection_date": "2019-09-04T20:08:35.233922", "headline": "Trial in 9/11 case at Guantanamo gets early 2021 start date", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A military judge on Friday set a date in early 2021 for the start of the long-stalled war crimes trial of five men being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison on charges of planning and aiding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nAir Force Col.

The Pentagon has been developing plans to withdraw as many as half of the 14,000 U.S. troops still there, but the Taliban want all U.S. and NATO forces withdrawn.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going down to 8,600 (troops) and then we\u2019ll make a determination from there,\u201d Trump said, adding that the U.S. is going to have a \u201chigh intelligence\u201d presence in Afghanistan going forward.\n\nReducing the U.S. troop level to 8,600 would bring the total down to about where it was when Trump took office in January 2017. According to the NATO/Resolute Support mission, the U.S. had 9,000 troops in Afghanistan in 2016, during the Obama administration, and 8,000 in 2017.\n\nTrump has called Afghanistan \u2014 where the Taliban harbored members of the al-Qaida network responsible for 9/11 \u2014 the \u201cHarvard University of terror.\u201d\n\nIf terror groups ever attacked America from Afghanistan again, \u201cwe will come back with a force like they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Trump said. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d\n\nAl-Qaida insurgents used Afghanistan as a base from which to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the United States. A month later, U.S. troops invaded Afghanistan, where they have remained ever since, making it the longest war in American history. More than 2,400 American service members have died in the conflict.\n\nA Taliban spokesman also has said that they\u2019re close to a final agreement. But even as the talks go on, there are persistent attacks by the Taliban across Afghanistan, and an affiliate of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, has taken root in the country and is expanding its base.\n\n\u201cTaliban and ISIS are still potential threats for the national security of Afghanistan and the US. The Afghan government strongly believes that any reduction of US forces in Afghanistan will be based on conditions on the ground,\u201d Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, said in a statement.\n\nHe added that the Afghan government hopes that Afghanistan and the U.S. will continue to fight international terrorism together as the countries have done for many years.\n\n\u201cThe level of threats from the Taliban and ISIS has increased in Afghanistan and it is therefore needed now more than any other time to counter them together and make sure that we will not leave any gap that would give the Taliban an opportunity to turn this country again in to a safe haven for international terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nA State Department spokesman said U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and his team continued to make progress Thursday in Doha, Qatar, toward an agreement with the Taliban. The spokesman was not authorized to publicly discuss the negotiations and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cIf and when we are able to announce an agreement, the process will pivot to intra-Afghan negotiations, where the Taliban will sit with other Afghans and together they will commit to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire,\u201d the spokesman said in an email.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s government expects that Khalilzad will soon update officials in Kabul on the Taliban talks.\n\nEven if Khalilzad is able to close a deal, it will remain for the Afghan government to try to negotiate its own agreement with the Taliban. Part of those talks would include determining a role for the Taliban in governing a country that it ruled before U.S. forces invaded in October 2001. So far, the Taliban have refused to negotiate with the Afghan government, which it views as illegitimate and a puppet for the West.\n\nOn Wednesday at the Pentagon, the top U.S. military officer said it was too early to talk about a full American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters that any U.S. deal with the Taliban will be based on security conditions on the ground and that Afghan forces aren\u2019t yet able to secure the country without help from allied forces.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not using the withdraw word right now,\u201d Dunford said. \u201cIt\u2019s our judgment that the Afghans need support to deal with the level of violence\u201d in the country today.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a key Trump supporter, and retired Gen. Jack Keane, a former Army vice chief of staff, also have expressed worry about trusting the Taliban to keep Afghanistan from becoming a launch pad again for international terror attacks.\n\n\u201cThe United States cannot contract out the American people\u2019s security to the Taliban who, in exchange for a U.S. withdrawal, simply \u2018promise\u2019 to guarantee that al-Qaida and ISIS (in Afghanistan) are denied haven,\u201d they wrote in an op-ed Wednesday in The Washington Post.\n\nGraham and Keane said they fear a U.S. withdrawal will not end the war and could start a new civil war as Afghan forces feel betrayed and abandoned and the Afghan government is severely undermined and weakened.\n\nThe State Department spokesman said any peace deal would not be based on \u201cblind trust,\u201d but would contain requirements and commitments from the Taliban that would be subject to U.S. monitoring and verification.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tameem Akhgar and Cara Anna in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.", "tokens": ["plan", "troop", "drawdown", "war", "history", "comment", "envoy", "round", "talk", "resolution", "war", "president", "war", "deal", "outcome", "talk", "trump", "timeline", "troop", "plan", "half", "troop", "force", "troop", "determination", "trump", "intelligence", "presence", "troop", "level", "total", "office", "mission", "troop", "administration", "member", "network", "terror", "terror", "group", "\u201c", "force", "trump", "insurgent", "base", "attack", "month", "troop", "war", "history", "service", "member", "conflict", "spokesman", "agreement", "talk", "attack", "affiliate", "group", "root", "country", "base", "threat", "security", "government", "reduction", "force", "condition", "ground", "spokesman", "statement", "government", "terrorism", "country", "year", "level", "threat", "time", "gap", "opportunity", "country", "haven", "terrorist", "spokesman", "envoy", "team", "progress", "agreement", "spokesman", "negotiation", "condition", "anonymity", "agreement", "process", "negotiation", "ceasefire", "spokesman", "email", "government", "official", "talk", "deal", "government", "agreement", "part", "talk", "role", "country", "force", "government", "puppet", "officer", "troop", "withdrawal", "chairman", "reporter", "deal", "security", "condition", "ground", "force", "country", "help", "force", "withdraw", "word", "\u201c", "judgment", "support", "level", "violence", "country", "today", "supporter", "vice", "chief", "staff", "worry", "launch", "pad", "terror", "attack", "people", "security", "exchange", "withdrawal", "promise", "haven", "op", "ed", "withdrawal", "war", "war", "force", "government", "spokesman", "peace", "deal", "trust", "requirement", "commitment", "monitoring", "verification", "_", "_", "report"]}, {"newspaper_name": "bostonherald", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/08/29/israel-iran-hezbollah-intensifying-missile-efforts/", "publication_date": "2019-08-29T00:00:00", "collection_date": "2019-09-04T20:08:37.304608", "headline": "Israel: Iran, Hezbollah intensifying missile efforts", "body": "By JOSEF FEDERMAN\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israel\u2019s prime minister on Thursday accused Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah of racing to build a missile-production program in Lebanon, vowing to destroy the ambitious project and issuing a stern warning to his enemies to \u201cbe careful.\u201d\n\nThe threats ratcheted up an already tense standoff that has pushed the bitter adversaries closer toward open, armed conflict in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cToday we uncovered part of Iran and Hezbollah\u2019s precision missile project. We know a few other things,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to eliminate this dangerous project. The aim of the publication today is to convey a message that we will not sit by and allow our enemies to arm themselves with deadly weapons directed at us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cToday I say to them: \u2018Dir Balak,\u201d he added, using a popular Arabic phrase that means \u201cbe careful\u201d and is often used as a warning or threat in Hebrew slang.\n\nHezbollah denies harboring missile factories. While the group\u2019s leader boasts about having highly accurate missiles, he denies that the group produces them.\n\nIsrael considers Iran to be its greatest enemy and has identified Hezbollah as the most potent military threat on its borders. The military estimates that Hezbollah, which battled Israel to a stalemate in a monthlong war in 2006, now has a vast arsenal of some 130,000 rockets and missiles.\n\nBut Israel believes that most of these weapons are relatively primitive unguided rockets and considers the acquisition of precision guided missiles by Hezbollah to be a major game changer. Israeli media have reported that early this week, Israeli drones targeted a Beirut facility housing a \u201cplanetary mixer,\u201d a large industrial machine that is critical to making missiles.\n\nHezbollah officials in Beirut said they had no comment on the Israeli accusations. Lebanese officials, including the prime minister, have accused Israel of carrying out a \u201cdangerous aggression\u201d and suggested the Israeli accusations were a pretext for further attacks against Lebanon.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said in the years after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the army was successful in thwarting attempts by Iran to smuggle guided missiles to Hezbollah through Syria, and a later effort to convert existing Hezbollah rockets into guided missiles. More recently, he said Israel has identified efforts by Iran and Hezbollah to establish a missile-production industry inside Lebanon.\n\nHe said Iran \u201chas not only relinquished\u201d its efforts. \u201cThey have intensified them,\u201d he said. He described \u201cmore efforts, more money, more operatives and more pressure from Iran.\u201d\n\nThe army identified three Iranian commanders and a top Hezbollah operative as the masterminds of the program.\n\nIt said the overall commander was Muhammad Hussein-Zada Hejazi, a brigadier general who reports directly to Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards\u2019 elite Quds force, while the Hezbollah official was identified as Fuad Shukr, described as a top commander who is wanted by the U.S. on terrorism charges.\n\nIsrael has acknowledged carrying out scores of airstrikes in Syria in recent years aimed primarily at preventing the transfers of sophisticated weapons, including guided missiles, to Hezbollah. This quiet war has expanded in recent weeks, raising the risk of a larger conflict that all sides say they want to avoid. Some critics have suggested that Netanyahu, who is fighting for his political survival in Sept. 17 elections, is motivated by domestic politics.\n\nLast weekend, an Israeli airstrike thwarted what Israel said was a plot by Iran to launch a series of explosives-laden attack drones meant to crash into targets in Israel. Iran denied the claims. U.S. officials have also said that Israel last month struck an Iranian target in Iraq, the first Israeli strike in that country since 1981. Then on Sunday came the alleged drone strike in a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut.\n\nIsrael has gone increasingly public with its efforts in an attempt to press Lebanon, and the international community, into action against Iran.\n\n\u201cIran is endangering Lebanon,\u201d Conricus said. He accused Iran of using Lebanese civilians as \u201chuman shields.\u201d\n\nUnder the U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war, Hezbollah is blocked from operating or possessing arms in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border. But the group, the most powerful actor in Lebanon\u2019s fragmented political system, is widely believed to have violated the resolution.\n\nWhile Israel considers Hezbollah its strategic enemy, Conricus accused Lebanon of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d by failing to stop the group\u2019s armament efforts.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council unanimously voted Thursday to extend the peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, by an additional year. But Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Hezbollah and Lebanon \u201ccontinue to significantly hinder the full and effective implementation\u201d of the force\u2019s mandate, which includes enforcing disarmament of southern Lebanon.\n\n\u201cShould these restrictions remain, UNIFIL\u2019s relevance is questioned,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nNetanyahu first accused Hezbollah of setting up secret rocket factories last year, claiming in a speech before the U.N. General Assembly that the group had them near Beirut airport, hiding them among civilians.\n\nThe Lebanese government denounced his statements at the time and the Lebanese foreign minister took dozens of ambassadors and diplomats on a tour of locations near the airport to dispel the allegations.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.", "tokens": ["minister", "proxy", "missile", "production", "program", "project", "warning", "enemy", "threat", "standoff", "adversary", "conflict", "week", "today", "part", "precision", "missile", "project", "thing", "news", "conference", "project", "aim", "publication", "today", "message", "enemy", "weapon", "today", "phrase", "warning", "threat", "missile", "factory", "group", "leader", "missile", "group", "enemy", "threat", "border", "estimate", "stalemate", "war", "arsenal", "rocket", "missile", "weapon", "rocket", "acquisition", "precision", "missile", "game", "changer", "medium", "week", "drone", "facility", "housing", "mixer", "machine", "missile", "official", "comment", "accusation", "official", "minister", "aggression", "accusation", "pretext", "attack", "spokesman", "year", "outbreak", "war", "army", "attempt", "missile", "effort", "rocket", "missile", "effort", "missile", "production", "industry", "effort", "effort", "money", "operative", "pressure", "army", "commander", "operative", "mastermind", "program", "commander", "brigadier", "general", "head", "force", "official", "commander", "terrorism", "charge", "score", "airstrike", "year", "transfer", "weapon", "missile", "war", "week", "risk", "conflict", "side", "critic", "survival", "election", "politic", "weekend", "airstrike", "plot", "series", "explosive", "attack", "drone", "target", "claim", "official", "month", "target", "strike", "country", "strike", "stronghold", "effort", "attempt", "community", "action", "civilian", "shield", "resolution", "war", "arm", "border", "group", "actor", "system", "resolution", "enemy", "group", "armament", "effort", "peacekeeping", "force", "year", "statement", "implementation", "force", "mandate", "disarmament", "restriction", "relevance", "ministry", "rocket", "factory", "year", "speech", "group", "airport", "civilian", "government", "statement", "time", "minister", "dozen", "ambassador", "diplomat", "tour", "location", "airport", "allegation", "_", "_", "writer", "report"]}, {"newspaper_name": "bostonherald", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/news/world-news/page/2/", "publication_date": "Unknown", "collection_date": "2019-09-04T20:08:37.681552", "headline": "Boston Herald", "body": "Bolsonaro to send army to fight huge fires in the Amazon", "tokens": ["army", "fire"]}]
