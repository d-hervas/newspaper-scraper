As President Obrador gets ready to give his state of the union address on Sunday, Sept. 1, Mexico\u2019s drug war has burst into flames again, the economy is flat, the health care system is creaking and, facing the wrath of U.S. President Donald Trump, he has cracked down on Central American migrants harder than ever. (AP Photo/Fernando Llano, File)\n\nHere's how he's doing in key areas of governance:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n___\n\nVIOLENCE RISES TO NEW HEIGHTS\n\nCartel violence, once confined to a few northern cities, has spread throughout the country. And, increasingly, innocent bystanders such as restaurant patrons and children are being killed.\n\nHomicides soared to nearly 35,000 last year, up from 27,000 during the 2011 peak of the government's confrontations with cartels. At least 40,000 Mexicans have been reported missing in recent decades; many believe their remains to be scattered across hundreds of makeshift graves dug in fields and the backyards of homes.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador's oft-repeated response to reports of violence, including against Mexican security forces, is \"hugs not bullets\" and \"the people are good and wise.\"\n\nThe president acknowledges that violent crime is the most serious challenge he faces. The federal government has assembled a National Guard force to improve security, pulling recruits from the military and police.\n\nLisa S\u00e1nchez, director of Mexicans United Against Crime, views L\u00f3pez Obrador's approach to crime as \"more of the same,\" saying he has taken a militarized approach that reacts to crime rather than trying to prevent it.\n\nBut there aren't enough boots on the ground: even if the National Guard achieves recruiting goals, it would only have one officer for every 1,000 inhabitants of Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir mission has also been diverted largely to immigration enforcement, as Mexico makes it more difficult for mostly Central American migrants to traverse the country en route to the U.S., under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n___\n\nSLUGGISH ECONOMY\n\nMexico's economy tends to slow down at the beginning of each six-year presidential term as the outgoing government turns off the spending spigot and the incoming one finds its bearings.\n\nBut this change of guard has been more dramatic as L\u00f3pez Obrador embarks on a philosophical overhaul that he calls the Fourth Transformation, comparing his rule to a shift of course on par with Mexico's independence from Spain.\n\nThe economy under L\u00f3pez Obrador is flirting with recession. Gross domestic product growth was just 0.2% over the first half of 2019, down from 1.9% the previous year, and Mexico's central bank recently downgraded its annual growth forecast to the 0.2%-0.7% range.\n\nSome factors hitting the economy are external, such as the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, which has thrashed global markets.\n\nAs recently as June, Trump also threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican imports despite having negotiated a new free trade agreement for North America last year. The Mexican congress has already ratified the deal, but U.S. legislators appear in no rush to sign off on it.\n\nSome of L\u00f3pez Obrador's own actions have bruised investor confidence, especially the cancellation of a $13 billion new airport for Mexico City that was already one-third built. And his austerity program has slashed spending to the bone. Consumer spending has been weak amid widespread layoffs and salary cuts for government employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nValeria Moy, director of the think tank Mexico, Como Vamos, feels the country is going backward as the president unravels programs and institutions.\n\n\"The whole administration revolves around the figure of the president,\" she says. \"How can you trust in a country where everything changes when the president changes?\"\n\nAnalyst Alfredo Couti\u00f1o of Moody's Analytics warns that \"if investors remain reticent,\" the economy could report no growth or a mild contraction in 2019.\n\n___\n\nCORRUPTION A TOUGH WEED TO UPROOT\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador campaigned on promises to staunch widespread corruption. It's a gargantuan task: Mexico scored 28 out of 100 points in Transparency International's 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index, where a lower score indicates higher levels of corruption.\n\nThat puts Mexico on par with Russia and behind countries such as Bolivia and Honduras in clean business dealings.\n\nRicardo Alvarado, a researcher with civic group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, says that while L\u00f3pez Obrador was able to capitalize during the election on the anger and frustration in society over corruption, his administration has yet to put forth a concrete plan to address the issue.\n\n\"The fight against corruption is more in the president's discourse than in practice,\" says Alvarado.\n\nThe crackdowns that have occurred have been messy, with sometimes dire consequences.\n\nThe administration kicked off with a full-on confrontation in January against fuel thieves that tap pipelines, resorting to tanker trucks to transport gasoline. That led to widespread gas shortages. When gasoline began to flow again from one refinery in central Mexico, residents flocked to a pipeline gusher to fill buckets. The gusher exploded into flames, killing nearly 100 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe L\u00f3pez Obrador administration has also taken a slash-and-burn approach to programs and expenditures, sometimes with a high cost for beneficiaries.\n\nFor instance, in response to suspected bribes being paid out for medicine sold to the national health care system, the government halted purchases, resulting in shortages of vaccines and lifesaving drugs for patients with conditions such as HIV.\n\nThe president vowed not to embark on a witch hunt against members of previous governments. Nonetheless, his administration has issued an arrest warrant for the former director of national oil company Pemex, for allegedly having received bribes in exchange for public contracts.\n\nAlso, the secretary of social development under the previous president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, has been jailed pending investigations into the alleged diversion of $260 million in public funds.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Peter Orsi contributed to this report.", "tokens": ["report", "state", "union", "year", "office", "president", "agenda", "day", "morning", "press", "conference", "smile", "visit", "town", "supporter", "approval", "rating", "sky", "office", "landslide", "election", "violence", "economy", "chip", "popularity", "file", "photo", "supporter", "rally", "year", "anniversary", "election", "square", "approval", "rating", "%", "poll", "month", "term", "benefit", "doubt", "president", "crime", "challenge", "file", "photo", "rally", "year", "anniversary", "election", "square", "state", "union", "address", "drug", "war", "flame", "economy", "health", "care", "system", "wrath", "migrant", "area", "governance", "rises", "violence", "city", "country", "bystander", "restaurant", "patron", "child", "year", "peak", "government", "confrontation", "cartel", "decade", "remain", "hundred", "grave", "field", "backyard", "home", "response", "report", "violence", "security", "force", "hug", "bullet", "people", "president", "crime", "challenge", "government", "force", "security", "recruit", "military", "police", "director", "approach", "crime", "approach", "crime", "boot", "ground", "goal", "officer", "inhabitant", "mission", "immigration", "enforcement", "migrant", "country", "route", "pressure", "_", "economy", "beginning", "year", "term", "government", "spending", "spigot", "one", "bearing", "change", "guard", "overhaul", "rule", "shift", "course", "par", "independence", "economy", "recession", "product", "growth", "%", "half", "%", "year", "bank", "growth", "forecast", "%", "range", "factor", "economy", "trade", "war", "market", "tariff", "import", "trade", "agreement", "year", "congress", "deal", "legislator", "rush", "action", "investor", "confidence", "cancellation", "airport", "third", "austerity", "program", "spending", "bone", "consumer", "spending", "layoff", "salary", "cut", "government", "employee", "director", "think", "tank", "country", "president", "unravel", "program", "institution", "administration", "figure", "president", "country", "everything", "president", "investor", "economy", "growth", "contraction", "_", "promise", "corruption", "task", "point", "score", "level", "corruption", "par", "country", "business", "dealing", "researcher", "group", "election", "anger", "frustration", "society", "corruption", "administration", "plan", "issue", "fight", "corruption", "president", "discourse", "practice", "crackdown", "consequence", "administration", "confrontation", "fuel", "thief", "tap", "pipeline", "tanker", "truck", "gasoline", "gas", "shortage", "gasoline", "refinery", "resident", "pipeline", "gusher", "bucket", "gusher", "flame", "people", "administration", "slash", "approach", "program", "expenditure", "cost", "beneficiary", "instance", "response", "bribe", "medicine", "health", "care", "system", "government", "purchase", "shortage", "vaccine", "drug", "patient", "condition", "president", "witch", "hunt", "member", "government", "administration", "arrest", "warrant", "director", "oil", "company", "bribe", "exchange", "contract", "secretary", "development", "president", "investigation", "diversion", "fund", "_", "_", "writer", "report"]}, {"newspaper_name": "bostonglobe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2019/09/04/world/4-dead-1-missing-1-injured-norway-helicopter-crash/", "publication_date": "2019-09-04T00:00:00", "collection_date": "2019-09-04T20:08:09.301859", "headline": "4 dead, 1 missing, 1 injured in Norway helicopter crash", "body": "HELSINKI (AP) \u2014 Authorities say four people are dead, one has been injured and another is missing after a helicopter crashed in northern Norway.\n\nThe Norwegian national emergency rescue center said it received an alert late Saturday afternoon about a crash southwest of the town of Alta.\n\nNorwegian news agency NTB said the helicopter belonged to a Norwegian company named Helitrans that used Alta as one of its bases.", "tokens": ["authority", "people", "helicopter", "emergency", "rescue", "center", "afternoon", "crash", "southwest", "town", "news", "agency", "helicopter", "company", "basis"]}, {"newspaper_name": "bostonglobe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2019/09/04/arts/ellie-goulding-weds-art-dealer-boyfriend-lavish-ceremony/", "publication_date": "2019-09-04T00:00:00", "collection_date": "2019-09-04T20:08:10.275711", "headline": "Ellie Goulding weds art dealer boyfriend in lavish ceremony", "body": "Newly married Ellie Goulding and Caspar Jopling leave York Minster after their wedding, in York, England, Saturday Aug. 31, 2019.

The reason for the attack was unclear.\n\nThe assailant was a 33-year-old Afghan citizen who had applied for asylum in France and was awaiting a response, a national police official said.\n\nThe suspect provided contradictory information to police, but the attack in the town of Villeurbanne did not appear to be terrorism-related, the official told The Associated Press.

It was unclear if the slain man knew the attacker, local police said.\n\nThe subway station in Villeurbanne was cordoned off, with police combing the area. Police were looking for possible accomplices.\n\nThe national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office so far had not been asked to participate in the investigation. The Lyon regional administration also said national security forces weren't involved in the search, which included a few dozen local police officers and a helicopter.\n\nFrance remains on high alert after several deadly Islamic extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press journalist Nicolas Vaux-Montagny reported this story in Villeurbanne and AP writer Angela Charlton reported from Paris.", "tokens": ["police", "officer", "place", "assailant", "person", "death", "other", "subway", "station", "reason", "attack", "police", "officer", "place", "assailant", "person", "death", "other", "subway", "station", "reason", "attack", "reporter", "subway", "station", "assailant", "person", "death", "other", "subway", "station", "reason", "attack", "officer", "assailant", "person", "death", "other", "subway", "station", "reason", "attack", "Police", "man", "asylum", "person", "other", "subway", "station", "suburb", "authority", "reason", "attack", "assailant", "citizen", "asylum", "response", "police", "official", "suspect", "information", "police", "attack", "town", "terrorism", "official", "official", "government", "policy", "reporter", "man", "suspect", "stabbing", "mayor", "victim", "man", "condition", "man", "attacker", "police", "subway", "station", "police", "area", "Police", "accomplice", "prosecutor", "office", "investigation", "administration", "security", "force", "search", "dozen", "police", "officer", "helicopter", "alert", "extremist", "attack", "_", "journalist", "story", "writer"]}, {"newspaper_name": "bostonglobe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/travel/2019/09/04/black-american-and-abroad-racism-travels-free/UGdYCnPr7rt1R4BlVVEk3I/story.html?p1=SectionFront_Feed_ContentQuery", "publication_date": "2019-09-04T00:00:00", "collection_date": "2019-09-04T20:08:18.027534", "headline": "Black, American, and abroad?

I was just trying to catch a cab in Paris.\n\nOver and over, a woman is smashing a taxi door into me, but I can\u2019t understand her rage. In that moment, I don\u2019t even feel the weight of the door.\n\nThe driver was a few steps ahead of me. As I made my way to his car, a woman frantically ran towards us across the street, from the opposite direction.\n\nI was already at his car door, so I opened it. And before I could get safely inside, the door was crashing into me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d been in Paris for six days \u2014 my first European adventure. I\u2019d heard stories about traveling while black, but France was everything I wanted it to be. \u201cBonjour,\u201d the natives greeted me everywhere I went. Each day, I explored the cafes where James Baldwin wrote \u201cGo Tell It on the Mountain\u201d and \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room.\u201d I found solace in the places he spent time, like Shakespeare and Company.\n\nParis was his escape. And as I sipped hot chocolate in the late of night on Paris sidewalks turned patios, I felt peace. Jumping on the Trampolines at the Tuileries with a sisterfriend, hands way in the air, across the street from the Louvre, I felt free. Even if it was fleeting, it was freeing.\n\nWith my feet in the grass at Luxembourg Gardens, I understood how this place became his home.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much a matter of choosing France \u2014 it was a matter of getting out of America,\u201d Baldwin told The Paris Review in 1984. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to me in France but I knew what was going to happen to me in New York. If I had stayed there, I would have gone under.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is no escaping racism. It comes with you in the carry-on bag called your skin.\n\nAnd as I stood outside of a fancy shopping district where security stands at the entrances, being attacked by a white woman wearing a suit in broad daylight, I knew I did not have the right to be right. I was taught to defend myself.\n\nI am American. I am black. And I am in France. I do not have the fame or black excellence of James Baldwin and Josephine Baker. Sometimes the love of black culture is so high, a few of our famous can sample freedom so long as power systems stay intact.\n\nBut I\u2019m an everyday black American woman visiting from Boston, where Crispus Attucks, a fugitive from slavery, was the first casualty of the American Revolution. I was born in Virginia, where the first enslaved Africans in America were sold 400 years ago.\n\nI knew I could not fight this lady. Eric Garner was choked to death five years ago on a New York street as he said, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nLast month, Daniel Pantaleo \u2014 the NYPD officer who choked Garner \u2014 was finally fired.\n\nThe chokehold was illegal. The killing was on video. Pantaleo didn\u2019t go to jail. Five years after Garner\u2019s death, he lost his job and pension. A GoFundMe for him already has raised over $160,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd folk call that justice. No, I could not hit her back.\n\nAll I could think about is how I might die or be detained if I defended myself from this woman shouting in my face and attacking me. I took a deep breath and shoved the door back in her direction, giving me just enough room to be, well, free.\n\nExcept I wasn\u2019t free. I couldn\u2019t even look back. I had to just keep pushing forward, toward my friend, toward safety.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I felt the sting of her violence on my arm, very red but only slightly swollen.\n\nThe next day, pain pierced my elbow as I boarded a plane back to the states. I dropped my phone and smashed it.\n\nI was not mad about my arm or my iPhone. I was hurt because I had not fought back.\n\nThe day after that, Nikole Hannah-Jones and The New York Times released The 1619 Project, an initiative observing the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery by examining the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans.\n\nWe became black Americans in 1619, our roots stripped from us, a new culture born.\n\nOur people, black American people, were seen as subhuman. Whiteness could not exist without our blackness. And richness rested upon our oppression.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 was less than 55 years ago. And we\u2019re still fighting for equity, for black lives to matter.\n\n\u201cThis belief, that black people were not merely enslaved but were a slave race, became the root of the endemic racism that we still cannot purge from this nation to this day,\u201d Hannah-Jones writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the thing about this nation is America is a world leader. Our influence is everywhere. If we cannot correct racism, if our country continues to uphold systemic oppression and anti-blackness, how can we expect to move about the world and not have run-ins with crazy cab ladies?\n\nI am a black American at all times. But being a black and brown Parisian isn\u2019t easy, either.\n\nThe Paris banlieues riots against brutality and inequality were in 2005. Protestors want liberation, too. Racism and classism live everywhere.\n\nWhile walking through a lovely Parisian boutique the day before the attack, a salesman asked me, \u201cMademoiselle, are you finding happiness here?\u201d\n\nWhat a beautiful question, I thought. We should all stop and ask ourselves that throughout the day. And the thing is, I was happy. I felt, for the first time in a very long while, light.\n\nEven as I held my elbow on the plane back to America, I clung to that buoyancy. I could still smell the fresh baked bread and that delectable taste of molten chocolate. I couldn\u2019t wait to sing \u201cBonsoir\u201d to my friends.\n\nI closed my eyes and held onto images of Monet\u2019s \u201cWater Lilies\u201d and thoughts of Baldwin and Richard Wright talking black creativity over cocktails back in the day.\n\nYes, I found happiness in France. And I smiled when my feet touched the cobbly sidewalks of Boston again, too. I\u2019m back in Massachusetts, where Belinda Sutton successfully petitioned the courts for her promised pension when her master died. Reparations. There\u2019s a lot of ways to fight back the system that seeks to singe our spirit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn America, in France, all around the world, I know this truth to be self-evident:\n\nDespite all people being created equal, it is not our lived experience. From sea to shining sea, black is black, and we deserve joy and we deserve to be free.\n\nJene\u00e9 Osterheldt can be reached at jenee.osterheldt@globe.com.

After three dozen protesters were arrested at the weekend rally, which ended with a clash with officers in downtown Boston, it was the latest flashpoint between courts and reform-minded Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins, who has come under previous criticism for declining to prosecute certain low-level cases.\n\nAnd again and again, Boston Municipal Court Judge Richard J. Sinnott said no.\n\nAgain and again, as protesters arrested at the Straight Pride Parade in Boston came before a judge Tuesday, a Suffolk County prosecutor asked for leniency \u2014 for dismissal of the charges or release without bail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuesday night, Rollins defended her office and said, \u201cThe judge punished the exercise of individuals\u2019 First Amendment right to protest.\u2019\u2019\n\nRollins said that some of the people were appropriately handled by the judge and \u201cwill be held accountable for actions that put the safety of the public and law enforcement at risk.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cFor those people now tangled in the criminal justice system for exercising their right to free speech \u2014 many of whom had no prior criminal record \u2014 I will use the legal process to remedy the judge\u2019s overstepping of his role,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nAs members of the police union looked on, Sinnott agreed to drop charges against just two of the 16 protesters who came before him Tuesday: a 63-year-old Vermont woman charged with disorderly conduct and a 21-year-old man from Worcester accused of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.\n\nProsecutors asked for dismissal of nonviolent charges against seven more people, most in exchange for eight hours of community service. Sinnott denied the requests. Prosecutors did not ask Sinnott to drop any charges of assault or of violence against police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive more people were held on bails ranging from $100 to $750. One man, 31-year-old Joshua Abrams of Stoneham, was held without bail because he faces charges in another county. He was accused of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.\n\nSinnott released the other nine without bail and scheduled court dates for November.\n\nIn one sharp exchange, prosecutor Jessica Erickson asked Sinnott to dismiss disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges against a 26-year-old Lowell man accused of forming a human chain with other protesters.\n\nHis behavior was \u201cnot appropriate,\u201d she said, but prosecuting him would not make the community any safer.\n\n\u201cNot appropriate? It sounds like he picked up the wrong fork at dinner,\u201d Sinnott replied tartly. The charges would stand.\n\n\u201cI think the general flavor of the room is that not even the district attorney\u2019s office is deeply invested in these cases,\u201d said Christopher Basso, a defense attorney who volunteered his time to represent some of the protesters.\n\nLawrence A. Calderone, vice president of the Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, said he was pleased to hear Sinnott imposing bails and declining to dismiss charges as prosecutors wished.\n\n\u201cWe think that these offenders that are here, most of them outside of the city of Boston, not residents of Boston, came here as agitators. Here for a specific reason, here to create havoc, not only for the Police Department but for the general citizenry that are around, for the visitors that are in downtown Boston trying to enjoy the last weekend of the summer,\u2019\u2019 Calderone said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe noted that previous district attorneys have also sought to dismiss disorderly conduct charges. \u201cThis DA\u2019s office is doing the same thing, but the judge on the bench has taken a different position.\u201d\n\nAlso Tuesday, three other people \u2014 Timothy Rego, Benjamin Boyd, and Kenneth Kraft Jr. \u2014 appeared before Judge Thomas R. Horgan, all on charges of assault and battery on a police officer. Horgan did not dismiss the charges.\n\nHe allowed their release but ordered them not to come into downtown Boston except for work.\n\nThe officer who patted Kraft down, Captain John Danilecki, was \u201coperating with the knowledge that these groups advocate violence and armed \u2018militant resistance,\u2019 \u201d an officer wrote in an arrest affidavit.\n\nAs protesters made their first appearances, questions arose about police conduct as videos from the march circulated online showing officers used pepper spray on protesters.\n\nBoston police officials said they plan to review officers\u2019 conduct, as they routinely do whenever officers use force.\n\nThe department\u2019s policy on the use of an incapacitating agent like pepper spray requires that officers \u201cgenerally confine\u201d its use to defend themselves or another person, or when an officer is met with active resistance.\n\nMayor Martin J. Walsh, in a statement on Sunday, said he takes \u201cany accusation of police misconduct seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also want to be clear that sowing division between people is exactly the goal of Straight Pride organizers, and I will not stand for it,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cJust as the people of Boston work to make our values of love, inclusion, and acceptance known to all, our public safety officials work tirelessly to keep people safe from harm every single day of the year, and that will never change.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 1-mile parade drew about 200 marchers Saturday, who were heckled by some 600 protesters from Copley Square to City Hall Plaza.\n\nThe parade, which included a Trump 2020 float, was organized by a group called Super Happy Fun America. Parade organizer Mark Sahady is part of Resist Marxism, a group founded by an alt-right leader that has a history of violence. That group had helped organize a \u201cfree speech\u201d rally in Boston in 2017 that critics said attracted white nationalists.\n\nAfter the parade ended, some protesters turned their anger toward police, accusing them of protecting the marchers.\n\nPolice on motorcycles drove up Congress Street to disperse the crowd, but protesters moved into the road to block their path. Officers moved into the crowd and grappled with protesters, in some cases using pepper spray. At least eight people could be seen being led away by police, including a woman who was limping.\n\nFour police officers were injured.\n\nGal Tziperman Lotan can be reached at gal.lotan@globe.com or at 617-929-2043.

Sinnott denied the requests. Prosecutors did not ask Sinnott to drop any charges of assault or of violence against police.\n\nSinnott \u201ccan\u2019t say \u2018I don\u2019t agree with your policy [to not prosecute certain non-violent crimes] Rachael Rollins,\u2019 \u201d Gertner said. \u201cAs a judge, I oftentimes disagreed with the cases brought in front of me.\u201d However, she said, \u201cin a system of divided power\u201d prosecutors make the charging calls.\n\nAnd forcing prosecutors to pursue cases they don\u2019t want isn\u2019t tenable, according to Robert Bloom, a BC Law professor and former prosecutor. If prosecutors think a case should be dropped, Bloom said, \u201cthen who\u2019s going to prosecute it?\u201d\n\nHe said a prosecutor \u201chas an ethical obligation to seek justice. If a prosecutor in the first instance doesn\u2019t feel like charges were justified, judges usually go along with the prosecutors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSinnott declined to comment through a Trial Court spokeswoman.\n\nThe Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure give prosecutors \u201cabsolute\u201d discretion to file a formal dismissal of charges, known as a nolle prosequi, which must be accompanied by a written statement from the government explaining the reasons for the decision.\n\nThe statements are often brief, citing developments such as the unavailability of a witness or the interests of justice.\n\n\u201cThe decision to enter a nolle prosequi as to all or any distinct part of pending charges is discretionary with the prosecuting attorney,\u201d say the rules posted to the official state website. \u201cPower to enter a nolle prosequi is absolute in the prosecuting officer from the return of the indictment up to the beginning of trial, except possibly in instances of scandalous abuse of the authority.\u201d\n\nA footnote says the federal courts allow \u201cdismissal by the prosecution only with leave of court. It did not seem advisable to engraft this additional requirement onto the Massachusetts rule, however, since it is doubted that the court has the power to compel the Commonwealth to proceed with a case which it does not believe warrants prosecution.\u201d\n\nGertner said that in seeking a judge\u2019s dismissal from the bench rather than a nolle prosequi, Rollins\u2019s office was seeking to compel some of the defendants to perform community service. With a nolle prosequi, they\u2019d walk out of the courthouse without any consequences.\n\nRegardless of the rules, the clash that played out Tuesday in Sinnott\u2019s courtroom mirrors a growing trend nationwide, according to Mark J. Geragos, a high-profile defense lawyer based in L.A. whose client roster has included Michael Jackson, Chris Brown and Winona Ryder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProgressive Prosecutors are often at odds with police and their unions and the clash plays out in the courtroom,\u201d Geragos wrote, adding that the \u201cDA\u2019s in Philadelphia and Cook County Chicago are the most prominent\u201d examples.\n\nIt\u2019s a trend that US Attorney General William P. Barr lamented during an address last month at the Grand Lodge Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s 64th National Biennial Conference.\n\nBarr cited what he called \u201cthe emergence in some of our large cities of District Attorneys that style themselves as \u2018social justice\u2019 reformers, who spend their time undercutting the police, letting criminals off the hook, and refusing to enforce the law,\u201d according to a transcript of his remarks. \u201cThese anti-law enforcement DAs have tended to emerge in jurisdictions where the election is largely determined by the primary.\u201d\n\nRollins on Tuesday defended her office, saying in a statement that Sinnott \u201cpunished the exercise of individuals\u2019 First Amendment right to protest\u201d and that the allegedly violent offenders who were charged \u201cwill be held accountable for actions that put the safety of the public and law enforcement at risk.\u2019\u2019\n\nSinnott, 63, is relatively new to the bench.\n\nGovernor Charlie Baker nominated him in 2017 and said at the time that Sinnott\u2019s \u201cdiverse legal experience and his commitment to human rights laws will make him a welcome addition to the Trial Court system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lifelong Boston resident, Sinnott \u201cpracticed civil and criminal law from his own law office for more than 25 years,\u201d Baker\u2019s office said at the time of his nomination. \u201cAn Army Reserve judge advocate and Iraq war veteran, Sinnott also serves as an adjunct professor at Suffolk University Law School where he teaches law of war. He also teaches law and human rights to international military officers at the U.S. Department of Defense Institute of International Legal Studies. He is a graduate of Boston Latin School, Norwich University and Suffolk University Law School.\u201d\n\nA Baker spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGal Tziperman Lotan and John R.

As the only woman on a team of 20 web developers working onsite at a Boston media company, Chiampa\u2019s requests to present her work at her team\u2019s weekly meeting were ignored. She was never invited to the conferences or hackathons that her colleagues attended. And despite good performance reviews, Chiampa said, she was steered toward nontechnical project management tasks instead of the development work she\u2019d been hired for.\n\nOnce, when she mentioned using Excel for data extraction, a male co-worker scoffed, \u201cOh, my wife likes Excel.\u201d\n\nFed up, Chiampa quit a few weeks ago. (She asked that the company not be named to avoid professional repercussions. The company did not respond to requests for comment). And while she was in the middle of telling her boss how hard it was to be the only woman on the team, he interrupted her: \u201cNope.\u201d\n\nThen he named a female web developer who didn\u2019t work in the office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn two surveys of more than 500 full-time professional women between the age of 25 and 45, half polled in September 2016 \u2014 a year before the #MeToo movement erupted \u2014 and the other half in September 2018, incidents of sexual harassment dropped, according to the University of Colorado study. But gender harassment, defined as negative treatment of women such as making sexist remarks, jumped 16 percentage points, experienced by a staggering 92 percent of women in 2018.\n\nThe #MeToo movement \u2014 including high-profile accusations against President Trump and now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as well as a trove of men in entertainment and media, including film producer Harvey Weinstein \u2014 has put a glaring spotlight on sexual misconduct. As a result, men have become fearful of being accused, management consultants note, causing them to stop traveling or having closed-door meetings with female co-workers because \u201cthey might #MeToo me,\u201d adding to the more subtle forms of discrimination highlighted in the study.\n\nA heightened awareness of inequities in the workplace could also be making women more likely to call out sexist behavior, analysts say.\n\nThis type of non-sexual harassment is harder to eradicate than full-on sexual misconduct because it\u2019s more ingrained in the culture, said Jodi Detjen, a Suffolk University management professor and cofounder of the gender equity consulting firm Orange Grove Consulting. Everyone knows that sexual harassment is wrong, she said, noting that, \u201cI\u2019ve not heard a single man say, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re making me not touch her anymore.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGender bias, on the other hand, is not as easy to root out.\n\nThe events of the past two years have increasingly put men and women at odds, Detjen said, adding to tensions in the workplace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s created a little \u2018us and them,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nEven if more overt forms of sexual harassment have decreased \u2014 something Boston employment attorney Rebecca Pontikes is not convinced has happened \u2014 she sees sexual harassment and gender bias as \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d that can hinder women\u2019s careers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same problem, which is that they see women as sex objects\u201d rather than equals, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just doing something different to act on it.\u201d\n\nMany companies have updated their sexual harassment policies and held training amid the recent cascade of high-profile sexual misconduct allegations, but gender harassment, while also illegal, has not been put under the same microscope. What\u2019s really needed, analysts say, is cultural change: looking at how decisions are made, how meetings are conducted, and how employees are hired, promoted, and evaluated. Getting more women into leadership roles would also help.\n\nGender bias is a constant in Katie Herzog\u2019s work as president of Eastern Point Consulting Group in Newton, whose clients are mostly law firms. Over the past 25 years, she\u2019s seen women being held back at every organization she\u2019s worked with, she said\n\nWhen they get pregnant, some are told they\u2019re on the \u201cmommy track,\u201d insinuating that they are no longer career-oriented; a woman trying to start a new venture at her law firm was told to stop making waves, while her male peers were encouraged to take risks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a large New York organization, a senior female employee was barred from attending an important meeting with a foul-mouthed client because her colleagues were worried he might offend her. Herzog was astonished: \u201cYou\u2019re not her father,\u201d she told a leader at the company.\n\n\u201cIt never occurred to them that she could stand up for herself,\u201d Herzog said.\n\nIf anything, the diminishment of women in the workplace has become more nuanced in the past two years, said Allison Esposito Medina, founder of Tech Ladies, an online community of 50,000 women involved in the male-dominated field of technology. There may not be as much leering or grabbing, but women who advocate for themselves are being dealt with more harshly, judging from what she\u2019s seen in the Tech Ladies online forum. Women asking for salary increases are being demoted, and sometimes fired, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming trickier and trickier because people are not doing the really obvious 1950s sexual harassment as much,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople think, \u2018Oh, #MeToo happened, Time\u2019s Up happened, and now everything\u2019s OK.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s clearly not. These movements, while important, can give men cover to discriminate against women in other ways, said Lauren Stiller Rikleen, the Boston-area president of the Rikleen Institute for Strategic Leadership and author of \u201cThe Shield of Silence,\u201d about how the fear of retaliation impedes the reporting of sexual harassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMen who don\u2019t want to mentor women or invite them to after-work gatherings can now justify these actions, or lack thereof, by saying they\u2019re trying to protect themselves, and women, from suggestions of impropriety. Beyond being detrimental to a woman\u2019s career, this type of gender exclusion \u201cperpetuates the idea of women as other,\u201d Rikleen said.\n\n\u201cIt is another opportunity for your bias to be hidden by trying to sound like you\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m lost in \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 much of the time because I\u2019m having the same conversations with women today that I had 30 years ago.\u201d\n\nKatie Johnston can be reached at katie.johnston@globe.com.

In public comments and private conversations, they described Lynch as an unflashy, nuts-and-bolts bureaucrat, an expert in how to get small things done at City Hall.\n\nThen he wound up smack in the middle of a bribery scandal.\n\nBy all accounts, John Lynch was a fairly run-of-the-mill staffer at City Hall, the guy in a suit at a neighborhood business fair, or the one standing at the edge of the picture at a ribbon-cutting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe just knew the city,\u201d said City Councilor Frank Baker, who considers Lynch a friend and said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the charges. \u201cHe\u2019d either know [the answer] or he\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s this guy in this department. Give him a call.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow 66, the Dorchester resident had worked for city government since the late 1970s, starting under Kevin White and serving under four mayors. He was nearing retirement, when, in mid-August, he abruptly resigned from his high-paying job as an assistant director of real estate in a city agency, giving just one day\u2019s notice. Two weeks later, word broke of his plea deal, and with it, the prospect of years in prison.\n\n\u201cMr. Lynch spent a lifetime helping others, and he has had a tremendous and positive impact on the community,\u201d said his lawyer, Hal Brennan, who has described Lynch\u2019s acceptance of the bribe as \u201can aberration.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sorry to his friends, family, colleagues, and the countless members of the community that hold him in high regard.\u201d\n\nFor the last three years, Lynch worked in a low-profile job at the Boston Planning & Development Agency that paid about $134,000 a year. Mostly, according to people familiar with his job, Lynch managed and oversaw maintenance of city-owned buildings in the Raymond L. Flynn Marine Park \u2014 a post far from the power brokers who negotiate high-profile projects on City Hall\u2019s ninth floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore that, Lynch spent 16 years at the city\u2019s Department of Neighborhood Development, where he ran small business programs and helped entrepreneurs navigate oft-arcane city programs. It was an important job, colleagues said, if unsexy. He was once quoted in the Globe while helping restaurants in the Fenway recover from a fire. He would staff a table the department set up at small-business night at the Columbia/Savin Hill Civic Association, a Dorchester neighborhood group.\n\nAnd he was fluent in the small programs the city runs to help entrepreneurs. Baker, who owned a restaurant on Dorchester Avenue before running for City Council, recalls Lynch maybe 15 years ago guiding him to tap a city fund that helped pay for new signs.\n\n\u201cHe was very helpful in trying to navigate that process,\u201d Baker said. \u201cHe was someone you could call with any sort of issue.\u201d\n\nHow Lynch\u2019s bureaucratic expertise led him to take a $50,000 bribe from a developer \u2014 who sources familiar with the case have said is Steven Turner \u2014 remains unclear.\n\nProsecutors have said little other than that Lynch used his \u201cofficial position within the BPDA\u201d to influence a ZBA member whom he knew to vote for an extension of zoning permits in 2017 for a condo site Turner owned in South Boston. They haven\u2019t said who Lynch may have influenced, or exactly how. Turner has not been charged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoning lawyers and others familiar with the ZBA\u2019s process say they\u2019re not sure how Lynch could have persuaded board members, at least through his official capacities. Nor do they see why Turner would pay $50,000 for what is, typically, a routine request to the board to extend permits on a project facing minor delays.\n\nIn the sometimes-braggy world of city politics, Lynch wasn\u2019t much of a name-dropper, say people who worked with him. He made modest political donations \u2014 $100 checks to various City Council members over the years, and $500 to Mayor Martin J. Walsh in recent years \u2014 fairly standard practice among city staff of a certain pay grade.\n\nHe owned rental property \u2014 real estate records indicate he and his wife own at least two three-deckers in Dorchester.\n\nAnd Lynch dabbled in real estate development; in 2015 he bought a run-down property next to his home in the Clam Point section of Dorchester and built a two-unit condo project there, according to county real estate records and city building permit data. He has since sold those condos for a little under $1.5 million combined, according to deeds filed in Suffolk County.\n\nTim Logan can be reached at tim.logan@globe.com.

That translates to millions more travelers flying out of Logan.\n\nThe battle between JetBlue and Delta for supremacy at Logan is not only increasing the number of new routes out of the airport at a rapid clip, it also means Logan is quickly on track to becoming one of the 10 busiest airports in the United States by 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelta plans to add 60 daily new flights out of Boston by 2021. That increase will result in an additional 10,500 passengers a day. JetBlue is adding 40 new flights a day, with an additional 5,100 passengers a day. It is slated to begin flights from Boston to London in 2021. Combined, the two airlines will add around 5.7 million seats a year.\n\nGrant said Boston currently ranks as the 15th busiest airport in the United States, up from 17th busiest in 2015.\n\n\u201cWith such growth, a move into the top 10 airports in the United States is a realistic ambition by 2022,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ultimate winner will inevitably be the traveler; increased choice, rapid capacity growth, and probably lower fares while demand accelerates to meet the capacity.\u201d\n\nFares may improve, but for weary travelers who already fear congestion at Logan, a large increase in passenger counts may not sound particularly appealing. Massport is currently in the midst of improvements to deal with congestion issues. Dubbed \u201cLogan Forward,\u201d the projects involve redesigns of the airport\u2019s roadways and terminals to make Logan easier and more efficient to navigate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraffic lanes will be widened and curbsides expanded. An additional 5,000 parking places will be added. Terminals B and C are being connected.\n\nThe airport is also pushing for more passengers to take public transportation and will move app ride passenger drop-offs \u2014 think Uber and Lyft \u2014 to a centralized location, which Massport believes will help ease congestion.\n\nMeanwhile, Terminal E will expand by 400,000 square feet with additional (and much needed) dining options and seven new gates.\n\nPassenger growth at Logan has been steady for the past decade. The airport had its busiest year ever in 2018, handling more than 40 million passengers for the first time in its history. Massport officials anticipate up to 47.6 million passengers a year at Logan by 2024.\n\nChristopher Muther can be reached at muther@globe.com.

Those students were tagged \u201cVIP,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe internal records are meant to show that USC gave far more deference to students whose families made generous donations.\n\nLawyers for Zangrillo have subpoenaed the university to hand over more information about its admission practices to show that favoritism to children of wealthy donors extended well beyond the athletics department.\n\n\u201cUniversity officials . . . were keenly aware that VIP applicants did not have to be admitted based on merit,\u201d Zangrillo\u2019s lawyers wrote in a motion filed Tuesday. \u201cIn short, USC is far from the crime \u2018victim\u2019 that it claims to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZangrillo\u2019s daughter, Amber, was rejected the first time she applied to USC in 2017. The following year, federal prosecutors said, Zangrillo arranged with William Rick Singer, a college consultant from California, to submit a second application that falsely stated she rowed crew.\n\nAmber Zangrillo was accepted as a transfer student that year and her father donated $50,000 to USC. Prosecutors said he also paid Singer $200,000.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that Singer, 58, was at the center of a conspiracy that involved dozens of parents across the country who were willing to pay up to $6.5 million to get their children into elite schools like Yale University and USC. Singer owned the Edge College & Career Network and bragged that he offered a full-service \u201cside door\u201d into those institutions, according to court documents.\n\nZangrillo\u2019s lawyer, Martin C. Weinberg, said the internal USC documents show that the $50,000 donation his client made was routine.\n\n\u201cThe documents fully legitimatize Mr. Zangrillo\u2019s donation to USC, that was made after the admission of his daughter,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cSuch donations are simply not illegal, not even unusual, and were welcomed by the school.\u201d\n\nUSC officials have said the university was a victim in a bribery and cheating scheme perpetrated by former athletic department staff, a college consultant, and parents who wanted their children to attend the selective school.\n\nOn Tuesday, USC reiterated its stance that it is not unusual for institutions to mark applicants with a \u201cso-called special interest tag.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. Zangrillo\u2019s filing appears to be part of a legal and public relations strategy to divert attention from the criminal fraud for which he has been indicted by a federal grand jury,\u201d university officials said in a statement. \u201cUSC remains confident that the court will agree with us that it need not produce the information and documents requested by the defendant.\u201d\n\nThe e-mails referenced by Zangrillo\u2019s lawyers \u201cdemonstrate that no athletic department official has the authority to compel admissions decisions,\u201d USC officials said.\n\nThe exhibits filed Tuesday showed several spreadsheets kept by campus officials who tagged students as \u201cVIP\u201d or \u201cspecial interest\u201d and included notations such as \u201clong time donors,\u201d \u201c1 mil pledge,\u201d and \u201c$15 mil.\u201d\n\nThe notes also included nonfinancial details about students like \u201cadopted,\u201d \u201c4.0 in fall term,\u201d and \u201c50 percent American-Indian.\u201d The spreadsheets were forwarded to Brunold by athletic department officials who showered him with praise and requests to consider students on their lists.\n\n\u201cYou look thinner \u2014 don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been working out,\u201d Donna C. Heinel, then the university\u2019s senior associate athletic director, wrote in March 2016.\n\nShe went on to mention an applicant whose relatives had been \u201cdonors for decades.\u201d Heinel is accused of conspiring with Singer to accept millions of dollars in bribes.\n\nIn an August declaration to the court, Brunold said his department \u201chas no involvement with respect to donations or potential donations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe admission department does not track donations by an applicant\u2019s family,\u201d Brunold said in a declaration submitted by USC attorneys, who are trying to squash the subpoena to hand over more internal e-mails and data. \u201cIf I had known that a prospective student\u2019s family had donated $50,000 or $100,000 to USC, it would not have affected the admission department\u2019s decision whether to admit the student.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut defense attorneys said that in one e-mail, Brunold said he maintained a \u201cuniversity-wide VIP spreadsheet.\u201d Between 68 percent and 83 percent of applicants with VIP status and who were tapped by the athletic department were accepted.\n\n\u201cThis pattern constitutes powerful circumstantial evidence that, contrary to the representations made in Brunold\u2019s declaration, money played a key role in the admission process,\u201d Zangrillo\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nMaria Cramer can be reached at mcramer@globe.com.", "tokens": ["university", "student", "application", "e", "mail", "dean", "admission", "administrator", "student", "lapse", "opportunity", "family", "student", "director", "admission", "lad", "\u201c", "ball", "tennis", "team", "ball", "cartoon", "teenager", "crudeness", "love", "metal", "exchange", "tennis", "prospect", "defense", "motion", "court", "college", "admission", "scandal", "admission", "officer", "applicant", "merit", "lawyer", "parent", "bribery", "scheme", "developer", "fraud", "e", "mail", "official", "spreadsheet", "student", "amount", "money", "family", "university", "student", "vip", "lawyer", "record", "deference", "student", "family", "donation", "university", "information", "admission", "practice", "favoritism", "child", "donor", "athletic", "department", "official", "applicant", "merit", "lawyer", "motion", "crime", "victim", "daughter", "time", "year", "prosecutor", "college", "consultant", "application", "crew", "transfer", "student", "year", "father", "prosecutor", "prosecutor", "center", "conspiracy", "dozen", "parent", "country", "child", "school", "singer", "service", "side", "door", "institution", "court", "document", "lawyer", "document", "donation", "client", "document", "donation", "admission", "daughter", "donation", "school", "official", "university", "victim", "bribery", "scheme", "department", "staff", "college", "consultant", "parent", "child", "school", "stance", "institution", "applicant", "\u201c", "interest", "tag", "filing", "part", "relation", "strategy", "attention", "fraud", "jury", "university", "official", "statement", "court", "information", "document", "defendant", "e", "mail", "lawyer", "department", "official", "authority", "admission", "decision", "usc", "official", "exhibit", "spreadsheet", "campus", "official", "student", "interest", "notation", "time", "donor", "\u201c", "mil", "pledge", "mil", "note", "detail", "student", "fall", "term", "percent", "spreadsheet", "department", "official", "praise", "request", "student", "list", "university", "director", "relative", "donor", "decade", "heinel", "million", "dollar", "bribe", "declaration", "court", "department", "involvement", "respect", "donation", "donation", "admission", "department", "donation", "family", "declaration", "attorney", "subpoena", "e", "mail", "datum", "student", "family", "admission", "department", "decision", "student", "defense", "attorney", "e", "mail", "university", "vip", "spreadsheet", "percent", "percent", "applicant", "vip", "status", "department", "pattern", "evidence", "representation", "declaration", "money", "role", "admission", "process", "lawyer"]}]
